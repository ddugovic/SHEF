SHEF
====

SHEF is an HTML editing framework and component for the Java Swing GUI library. It can be plugged into the `javax.swing.JEditorPane` text component, adding usable HTML WYSIWYG editing capabilities. In addition, SHEF works around various `JEditorPane` quirks and adds functionality currently missing from the standard Swing text implementation.
